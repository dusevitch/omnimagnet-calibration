# The Omnimagnet Calibration Gui

This gui is used to calibrate an omnimagnet (https://www.telerobotics.utah.edu/uploads/Main/Petruska_TMAG14.pdf), a custom electromagnet of the Utah Telerobotics lab that can generate a magnetic dipole field in any direction.

Omnimagnet math calibrations are based off of the Paper by Andrew J. Petruska, Andrew Edelmann, and Bradley J. Nelson et al: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7817832

An associated github file with helper functions and code made by Andrew J. Petruska is also used: https://github.com/M3R-CSM/electromagnet-calibration

Specific code was included to calibrate a cubic core omnimagnet and is reported in this paper: (UNDER REVIEW)
